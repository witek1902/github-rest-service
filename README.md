# GitHub REST Service Example with Retrofit and GSON

- I use Retrofit, because I wanted to try something different than the standard RestTemplate,
- In real world should be added pagination and sorting to endpoint,
- Package "integration" could be separate module and then could be create parent project (parent pom.xml) and a lot of child projects,
